# Dental Lab Quiz
[Live Site](http://dentallabquiz.surge.sh/)

This database was built using PostgreSQL, Knex.js, Node.js, and Express. I built this database for a project I made to dig into how React, Radio Buttons, and Forms work together. I used to work in a dental lab and one issue that we had was the large volume of knowledge that is required for working in this field. Based on that experience I decided to focus this quiz around some of that information. The repo for that client side can be found [here](https://github.com/lnchapin/dentalClient-).
